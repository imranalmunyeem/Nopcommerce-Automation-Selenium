How to run project on your device:

	Step 1: Download Java JDk 8, install it, set it as Environment variable, also set its bin path as environment path.

	Step 2: Download and install eclipse.

	Step 3: Download Maven, install it, set it as Environment variable, also set its bin path as environment path.

			To check installation is success, open your command, write "java -version" // it will show you the version if available

			"mvn -version" // it will show you the version if available

	Step 4: Open eclipse and then open the whole project from the file system.

			[N.B: You don't need to download any additional jar. Maven dependency will take care of it]

	Step 5: I removed the credentials from all the classes. You just have to put new credentials in the classes to run the test. It will start working. I already separated the web elements in page factory.

[N.B: you credentials won't work anymore after few hours because this is a demo website for testing.]
